###### Note for Section 4 - Illustrative examples - simulated data:
Because the 'simulation.case1.R', 'simulation.case2.R' and 'simulation.case3.R' codes take a huge amount of time to run the ECM procedure for fitting the EFM-NLME and FM-NLME models, we record every 100 replications result in the subfolder ''SS-simulation1'', ''SS-simulation2'', and ''SS-simulation3'' from ./Data/Simulation/' respectively so that one can use the R codes 'Fig1.R', 'Fig2.R', 'Fig3.R', 'Fig4.R', 'Tab1', 'Tab2', and 'Tab3' to obtain the final results immediately.
To reproduce the results presented in Figures 1 to 4 and Tables 1 to 3, just  load the subfolder 'SS-simulation1', 'SS-simulation2', and 'SS-simulation3' files in the './Data/Simulation/' and then run the scripts 'Fig1.R', 'Fig2.R', 'Fig3.R', 'Fig4.R', 'Tab1', 'Tab2', and 'Tab3' in the subfolder './Code/';

###### Note for Section 5 - Illustrative examples - ACTG 315 data:
Because the 'actg315_code.R' code takes a huge amount of time to run the ECM procedure for fitting the FM-NLME and EFM-NLME models, we record these intermediate results in 'ACTG315result.RData' so that one can use the R codes 'Fig5.R', 'Fig6.R', 'Fig7.R', 'Fig8.R', 'Tab4.R', 'Tab5.R', and 'Tab6.R' to obtain the final results immediately.
