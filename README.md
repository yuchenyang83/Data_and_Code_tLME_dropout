###### Note for Section 5 - Illustrative examples - simulated data:
Because the 'simSEM25.R', 'simSEM50.R' and 'simSEM75.R' codes take a huge amount of time to run the MCECM procedure for fitting the LME and tLME models with non-ignorable dropout, we record every 100 replications result in the subfolder ''SS-simulationSEM-t25'', ''SS-simulationSEM-t50'', and ''SS-simulationSEM-t75'' from ./Data/Simulation/' respectively so that one can use the R codes 'Fig1.R', 'Fig2.R', 'Fig3.R', 'Fig4.R', 'Fig5.R', 'Tab1', 'Tab2', 'Tab2', 'Tab4', and 'Tab5' to obtain the final results immediately.
To reproduce the results presented in Figures 1 to 5 and Tables 1 to 5, just  load the subfolder ''SS-simulationSEM-t25'', ''SS-simulationSEM-t50'', and ''SS-simulationSEM-t75' files in the './Data/Simulation/' and then run the scripts 'Fig1.R', 'Fig2.R', 'Fig3.R', 'Fig4.R', 'Fig5.R', 'Tab1', 'Tab2', 'Tab2', 'Tab4', and 'Tab5' in the subfolder './Code/';
