\title{Arrange multiple plots on a single page (with an optional title row)}
\usage{
multiplot(
  ...,
  plotlist = NULL,
  file,
  cols = 1,
  layout = NULL,
  title = "",
  fontsize = 12,
  fontfamily = "Helvetica"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more plot objects (typically \pkg{ggplot2} plots or other
grid-compatible grobs) to draw.}

\item{plotlist}{list or \code{NULL}. An optional list of plots to include in
addition to those passed via \code{...}. This is useful when the plots are
stored in a list.}

\item{file}{character. \strong{Deprecated/ignored.} Present for historical
compatibility; the function does not write to a file.}

\item{cols}{integer(1). Number of columns in the layout when \code{layout}
is not supplied. The number of rows is computed from the number of plots.}

\item{layout}{integer matrix or \code{NULL}. A matrix specifying the
arrangement of plots. Each positive integer in the matrix identifies the
position(s) for the corresponding plot (e.g., all cells with value \code{2}
are occupied by the second plot). When a non-empty \code{title} is used,
a top row of zeros is prepended internally to reserve space for the title.}

\item{title}{character(1). An optional page title placed in a dedicated top
row spanning all columns.}

\item{fontsize}{numeric(1). Title font size (points) passed to \code{grid::gpar()}.}

\item{fontfamily}{character(1). Title font family passed to \code{grid::gpar()}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is called for its side
effect of drawing plots on the active graphics device.
}
\description{
Draws several plots on the current graphics device in a grid layout. The
layout can be supplied explicitly via a matrix, or it will be constructed
from the requested number of columns. If a non-empty \code{title} is given,
an extra top row is reserved for the title text.
}
\details{
The function relies on the \pkg{grid} system: it opens a new page
(\code{grid::grid.newpage()}), sets up a \code{grid::grid.layout()} and then
prints each plot into its assigned viewport. If only a single plot is
provided, it is printed directly without creating a new page layout.

The \code{layout} matrix governs plot placement and spanning. For example, a
matrix such as \code{rbind(c(1, 1), c(2, 3))} places plot 1 across the top
row (spanning two columns), and plots 2 and 3 in the bottom-left and
bottom-right cells, respectively.
